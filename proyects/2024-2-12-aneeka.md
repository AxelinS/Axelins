### What is Aneeka?
Aneeka is an AI-powered VTuber designed for entertainment and AI-related discussions. She interacts dynamically with Twitch chat and voice input, responding with personality and charisma using TTS and a VTuber avatar that moves and expresses emotions based on the conversation.

### What functions does it have?
ยบ Chat & Voice Interaction: Reads Twitch chat and listens to voice input via speech-to-text, responding in real-time.

ยบ AI Model: The LLM runs locally on my machine, generating responses tailored to chat engagement and direct speech.

ยบ Emotion-Based Expressions: Uses a custom sentiment analysis model to adjust the VTuber's expressions based on the mood of its responses.

ยบ Optimized Performance: Originally built in Python but later rewritten in Go for better speed and efficiency.

### My experience
Developing Aneeka was an enriching experience, allowing me to deepen my knowledge in LLMs, AI fine-tuning, speech processing, and performance optimization. Implementing a sentiment prediction model further enhanced the project, making Aneeka more expressive and immersive.

It is undoubtedly an enriching project for my knowledge and I would recommend people try to do something similar if they would like to learn more about LLMs since this can give you a good approach and you will learn a lot.
