### Food Scholarship App

Our team is developing a Food Scholarship App to optimize the scholarship process at CUTonala, making it easier to use compared to the previous system. This app eliminates material waste, such as paper and ink, and improves efficiency. Additionally, it assists administrative staff in managing users and the scholarship service more effectively.

The project consists of:

A mobile app (currently for Android) built with React Native.
A server built with Go, functioning as a REST API to handle app requests.
A SQLite database for data management.

### My experience
Developing this project alongside my teammates was an enriching experience. We worked as a team, proposing ideas and solutions to various challenges, seizing the opportunity to replace the existing scholarship system with a digital application.

Personally, I was responsible for:

Designing the application architecture.
Developing the REST API using Go.
Defining the methodology to ensure we met the needs of both our client (academic services) and users (students).
This experience allowed me to refine my technical skills while collaborating effectively to create a meaningful and functional solution.
