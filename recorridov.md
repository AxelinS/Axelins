### What does it consist of?
It is a website whose objective is to be able to take a virtual tourist tour of the most characteristic points of Tonalá, Jalisco. This page has different locations relevant to tourism and data about them, it also integrates the Google Maps API to be able to take a tour using street view for a better immersion.

Users have the option of sharing their opinion and experience of tourist sites as long as they have an account created on the site, they simply have to select the tourist point they wish to leave their comment or rate with a star system.


### How was it made?
It was developed using NodeJS with Express and uses the model view controller (MVC) architecture where the view was made using EJS to make the pages more dynamic according to the content that is added to the points in the database, in addition security measures were implemented to prevent SQL injection by sanitizing the data received by the controllers and sending the clean data to the database and uses the "helmet" library to improve the security of the http page.


### My experience
This project was enriching to practice my back-end development using MVC in addition to learning the security measures that must be taken to prevent certain cyberattacks that could affect the integrity of our application.
But in addition to the programming skills acquired, I also improved my teamwork skills, since I led a team of 5 people (including myself) to carry out the project meeting objectives and deadlines, in general it was an enriching experience in this aspect.
